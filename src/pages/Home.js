                        of the full-stack web developer boot camp at John Hopkins University.
                        Iâ€™m seeking a career where I can be part of an awesome team that creates
                        beautiful, clean code. In 2012, I obtained a bachelor of science in
                        graphic design with a minor in painting. Utilizing browser-based
                        technologies, server-side development, and databases, along with my
                        newly acquired skills in JavaScript and React.js have given me the
                        opportunity to create beautiful, responsive and user-friendly
                        applications on three collaborative projects. With an eye for
                        design and a newfound passion for web development, I would be
                        a great asset to any team.
